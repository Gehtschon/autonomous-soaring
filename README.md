# Autonomous Glider Flight Project
This work addresses the field of autonomous glider flight, focussing on the use of natural updrafts,
in particular thermal lift, for sustained flight without motor assistance. The project creates a
robust basis for autonomous gliding missions using a modern glider model equipped with sensors
such as GPS, barometer, and airspeed sensor and controlled by an autopilot system.
The main objective is to carry out predefined missions by strategically utilizing thermals or
other natural updrafts. An updraft estimator determines the optimal updraft locations and for-
wards this information to a central control system. Machine learning algorithms then determine
sensible flight maneuvers.
